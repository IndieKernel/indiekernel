### Oy, IndieKernel speaking here ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the IndieKernel codebase. You'll find all website posts code and many other experiments or tools.

### Game design/development and system programming ðŸ¤” ?

Yep. Two domains that seems to have nothing in common and if you look a little bit more close, they have a lot:

- Game optimization
- Game engine
- Platform hardware
- ...

Behind the Game Design aspect, we often forget that a video game is a program such as your Discord client or your web browser. And as they are programs, they obey **same execution rules** regarding of the kernel and how the memory must be managed.

However, as they stress a lot the central processing unit and the graphical one, it is pretty important to **take care** of how they are built.
